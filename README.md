## About
This repository is a combined collection of exercises and mini-projects from an Intro to Computer Science course. It features programs written in C and Python, covering topics such as loops, recursion, games, and a Wordle clone. The main project includes a unified menu to navigate and run each exercise or mini-project.
## Features
* Interactive Main Menu â€“ lets you easily choose and launch any exercise or mini-project.

* Ex2 â€“ Loops and Conditions: practice basic control flow with loops and conditional statements.

* Ex3 â€“ Recursion: explore recursive problem-solving through simple algorithmic challenges.

* Ex4 â€“ Connect-N Game: a terminal-based game where players compete to connect N pieces in a row.

* Ex5 â€“ Bank Simulation: manage accounts and transactions with basic file and data operations.

* Ex6 â€“ New World: experiment with arrays, structures, and dynamic interactions.

* Ex7 â€“ Wordle Clone: a Python-based version of the popular word-guessing game.

To interact with the program:
- Enter the number corresponding to a menu item to run that exercise.
- Enter `0` to exit the program.
- If you enter a number that doesnâ€™t exist in the menu, an error message will be displayed.

For example, selecting option `1` from the menu will lead to:
