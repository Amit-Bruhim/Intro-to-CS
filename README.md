The main project includes a unified menu to navigate and run each exercise or mini-project.
## Features
* Interactive Main Menu â€“ lets you easily choose and launch any exercise or mini-project.

* Ex2 â€“ Loops and Conditions: practice basic control flow with loops and conditional statements.

* Ex3 â€“ Recursion: explore recursive problem-solving through simple algorithmic challenges.

* Ex4 â€“ Connect-N Game: a terminal-based game where players compete to connect N pieces in a row.

* Ex5 â€“ Bank Simulation: manage accounts and transactions with basic file and data operations.

* Ex6 â€“ New World: experiment with arrays, structures, and dynamic interactions.

* Ex7 â€“ Wordle Clone: a Python-based version of the popular word-guessing game.
